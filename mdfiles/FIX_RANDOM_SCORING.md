# 🔧 Fix for Random Scoring Issue

## 🎯 **Problem Identified:**

The random scoring system is working in the backend (generating random scores), but the SessionResponse model is not properly returning the updated fields. The issue is that the session update is happening but the response doesn't include the random scores.

## ✅ **Solution:**

I need to ensure that:
1. The session update endpoint properly applies random scoring
2. The SessionResponse model includes all updated fields
3. The dashboard shows the random scores correctly

## 🔧 **What's Happening:**

1. **Session Creation**: ✅ Working (sessions are being created)
2. **Random Score Generation**: ✅ Working (backend generates random scores)
3. **Database Update**: ❌ Issue - scores not being saved properly
4. **Response Return**: ❌ Issue - updated scores not returned
5. **Dashboard Display**: ❌ Issue - shows old data

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. Fix the session update endpoint to properly save random scores
2. Ensure the SessionResponse model returns all fields
3. Test the complete flow with camera and scoring
4. Verify dashboard shows random scores

## 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

After selecting a topic and completing a session:
- ✅ Camera should capture frames and send to backend
- ✅ Backend should generate random emotion data
- ✅ Session should be updated with random scores
- ✅ Dashboard should show realistic random scores
- ✅ All analysis should use random but meaningful data

The system is 90% working - just need to fix the data persistence and response issues!
