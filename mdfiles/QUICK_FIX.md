1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added proper error handling in the LLM service
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented comprehensive fallback question generation
3. **API Key Management**: Improved OpenAI API key validation and initialization
4. **Backend Integration**: Enabled LLM service in all relevant endpoints

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ **AI Analysis**: Working with comprehensive fallback analysis  
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents crashes
- ✅ **User Experience**: Seamless experience regardless of API availability

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd new-frontend

## 🔑 Optional: OpenAI API Key Setup

For enhanced AI features, you can set up an OpenAI API key:

1. **Get API Key**: Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Edit Environment**: Update `backend/.env` file
3. **Replace**: Change `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here` to your actual key
4. **Restart**: Restart the backend server

**Note**: The system works perfectly without an API key using intelligent fallback questions!
