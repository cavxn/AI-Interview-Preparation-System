# üé§ AI Interview System - Comprehensive Features

## Overview

The AI Interview System now includes comprehensive features for real-time emotion detection, speech-to-text, and intelligent question generation. Here's what's been implemented:

## üöÄ New Features

### 1. **Real-time Emotion Detection**
- Uses your trained `emotion_model.h5` for accurate facial emotion recognition
- Detects 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- Real-time confidence scoring and eye contact analysis
- Fallback to heuristic-based detection if model fails

### 2. **Speech-to-Text Integration**
- Built-in browser speech recognition
- Real-time transcription of user responses
- Continuous listening with start/stop controls
- Automatic text processing for analysis

### 3. **AI-Powered Question Generation**
- **6 Interview Topics**: Software Engineering, Data Science, Product Management, Marketing, Sales, Leadership
- **3 Difficulty Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: LLM creates 5-6 relevant questions per topic
- **Smart Question Flow**: Progressive difficulty and follow-up questions

### 4. **Comprehensive Analysis**
- **Text Analysis**: Content quality, relevance, communication skills
- **Emotion Analysis**: Confidence, emotional stability, engagement
- **Combined Insights**: AI provides feedback on both verbal and non-verbal cues
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant analysis after each response

## üéØ How It Works

### Step 1: Topic Selection
1. User selects interview topic (Software Engineering, Data Science, etc.)
2. Chooses difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
3. AI generates 5-6 relevant questions for the topic

### Step 2: Interview Session
1. **Camera Activation**: Real-time emotion detection using your trained model
2. **Question Display**: Shows current question with progress tracking
3. **Speech Recording**: User speaks their answer (speech-to-text)
4. **Real-time Analysis**: Emotion and eye contact monitoring
5. **AI Feedback**: Comprehensive analysis after each response

### Step 3: Analysis & Feedback
- **Overall Score**: 0-100 based on content and delivery
- **Communication Score**: Clarity and structure assessment
- **Confidence Score**: Based on emotional indicators
- **Emotional Insights**: Analysis of facial expressions and engagement
- **Strengths & Improvements**: Specific actionable feedback

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. **Enhanced Emotion Detector** (`emotion_detector.py`)
```python
# Uses your trained model for accurate emotion detection
model = load_model('emotion_model.h5', compile=False)
emotion_labels = ['Angry', 'Disgust', 'Fear', 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Surprise', 'Neutral']

# Real-time analysis with confidence scoring
def detect_emotion_simple(self, frame):
    # Face detection + model prediction
    # Returns emotion and confidence score
```

#### 2. **Advanced LLM Service** (`llm_service.py`)
```python
# Topic-based question generation
def generate_interview_questions(self, topic, difficulty, count):
    # AI generates relevant questions for specific topics

# Comprehensive analysis combining text + emotion
def analyze_comprehensive_response(self, question, answer, emotion_data):
    # Analyzes both verbal and non-verbal cues
```

#### 3. **New API Endpoints** (`main.py`)
- `POST /generate-questions` - Generate questions for topics
- `POST /analyze-comprehensive` - Combined text + emotion analysis
- Enhanced emotion analysis with session tracking

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **Camera Feed Component** (`CameraFeed.js`)
- Real-time video capture and emotion analysis
- Automatic frame processing every 2 seconds
- Visual feedback for analysis status
- Error handling for camera permissions

#### 2. **Enhanced Interview Page** (`InterviewPage.js`)
- Topic selection interface
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Real-time emotion display
- Comprehensive feedback panels

## üìä Data Flow

```
1. User selects topic ‚Üí AI generates questions
